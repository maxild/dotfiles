Reference Assemblies and DNX

See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34136228/unable-to-resolve-assembly-reference-issue-without-frameworkassemblies

you can add it like

"frameworkAssemblies": {
  "System.Runtime": {
    "type": "build",
    "version": "...."
  }
}

so it doesn't get into the final nuspec file, which should be the cleaner solution.

adding facades (reference assemblies) like System.Runtime as framework assemblies in the project.json leads to entries in the nuspec file, if dnu pack is used to generate a nuget package. Using "type": "build" leads to a successful build, since it gets included for compilation, but the nuget package nuspec doesn't reference it -- the facade only contains type forwards anyway.
