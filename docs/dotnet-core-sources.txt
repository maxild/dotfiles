There once was a feature 'dnu sources' that didn't make it into RTM. The feature is still possible to achieve manually. BUT in order to work as a package, that is sourced, have to only depend on other packages, that have not been purged from there feed. This is only so on nuget.org, where packages are never purged. On myget the problem is that packages are purged regularly, and therefore the sources (project.json) will depend on packages that does not exist anymore.

You can see a left over in aspnetcore project.json files where repository information is stored. But how do a package now about the sha1?
